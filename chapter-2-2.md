## Create a component for movie items that receive `Movie` information from inputs.
### Requirements
- Add a required input of type `Movie`
  - There's a sample movie in `src/app.component.ts`
- Update the HTML template to render the movie with the following information:
  - Title
  - Release date - no required formatting
  - Budget
    - In `$ (value) million)` format - eg. `$ 1 million`
  - Duration
    - In `(value) min` format - eg. `1 min`
- Update `src/app.component.html` to pass the sample movie as an input
- Ensure the component renders properly
