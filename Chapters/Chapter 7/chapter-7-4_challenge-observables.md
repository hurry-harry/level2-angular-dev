## In this challenge, we we have to update our components to use Observables instead of Signals.

### Requirements:
- Update `src/home/home.component.ts` to make it handle the new Observable and render the list of all movies.
- Update `MovieDetailsComponent` to make it handle the new Observable and render movie details.
- The app should work just like it did before with no visible difference to the user.
